# AstroTools
Useful python based tools for astronomy.

These tools are written in python3, the easiest way to use them is to download and install the most current 3.x version of anaconda https://www.anaconda.com/download/, then run them from the command line. The tools often require changes to the python files directly so you will need a text editor or IDE, luckily anaconda comes with Spyder which works well enough. For simple use there is a section with basic figure parameters which can be used, and there are often more advance features further into the file though these are separated from the basic functionality.
